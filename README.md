Steganography and Steganalysis

Definition:

Steganography is the technique of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection; the secret data is then extracted at its destination. 

Steganography hides the existence of a message by transmitting information through various carriers. Its goal is to prevent the detection of a secret message. 


cover medium + hidden information + stego key = stego-medium 

The Least Significant Bit (LSB) method is a really common and famous steganographic method in which the secret information is hidden in the least significant bits of the image.
